# Grido
Little Android app to check out popular and top rated movies.

In order to build and build run the app you need to create an account on the themoviedb.org site and request an API key there. For more info on the moviedb.org API check out https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en 

Once you have aquired the API key you just copy and paste the **API key** into the **keys.xml** file at **app/src/main/res/values/keys.xml**.
