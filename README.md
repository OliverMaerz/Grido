# Grido
Little Android app to check out popular and top rated movies.

In order to build and build run the app you need create an account on the themoviedb.org site and request an API key. For more info on the moviedb.org check out https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en 
Once you have received the API key you copy and paste the API key into the keys.xml file at app/src/main/res/values/keys.xml
